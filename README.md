Flappy Bird is a simple game, but it can be very addictive and challenging.Combination of simplicity and challenge is what made Flappy Bird so popular when it was first released.
The player controls a bird by tapping the screen to make it flap its wings. The bird must fly through a series of pipes that are moving from left to right across the screen. If the bird hits a pipe or falls below the bottom of the screen, the game is over.


The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by passing through as many pipes as possible without hitting them. The player scores one point for each pipe that they pass through.
